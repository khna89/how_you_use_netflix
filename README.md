# how_you_use_netflix
Visualization of the Netflix data with shiny app (R) and flexdashboard (R).
If you don't code and have no idea what this is all about and you want to directly use the data visualization app - go here https://nin-khodorivsko.shinyapps.io/my_netflix_project/ . You will need to upload a file that you can get from Netflix. Netflix instructs how to do that here: https://www.netflix.com/account/getmyinfo . After you've download the data - unzip the folder. You will find the necessary file in netflix-report/CONTENT_INTERACTION.
